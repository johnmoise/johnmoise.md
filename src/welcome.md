# Welcome to my blog!

My name is John and I am a second-year medical student passionate about cancer biochemistry and computer science. 

This blog is structured somewhat differently than a prototypical blog in that it is not organized by chronology. Instead, I have grouped my posts by content into broad categories:

* Projects
* Random Questions
