# Welcome to my site!

My name is John and I am a second-year medical student passionate about cancer biochemistry and computer science.

My goal in creating this site is to establish a repository for organizing my various hobbies and extracurricular interests. Please feel free to look around - I hope you find something of interest!

This site is structured somewhat differently than a prototypical blog in that it is not organized by chronology. Instead, I have grouped my posts by content into broad categories:

* Projects
* Random Questions

Please feel free to explore and see what you find!
